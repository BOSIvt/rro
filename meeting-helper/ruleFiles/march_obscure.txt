#  Partially based on Henry Prakken's excellent formalization of a large part of Robert's Rules 

# It should be noted that no effort is being made to make these rules strictly conform to the any version of Robert's Rules of Order. These rules are an almagation of Henry Prakken's formalization, of the 1915 version of Robert's Rules, and of suggestions by various people.
# Note that there is also an updated version of Robert's Rules which you can buy as a book. I don't have the book, and so these rules DO NOT reflect the "current" version of RRO.
# At some future time perhaps a version strictly following the 1915 version of RRO will be released.

## NOTE: 
##  I made one predicate, subsidiaries allowed, which covers amendments
##  unless AMENDABLE is specified. Should probably be clarified.
