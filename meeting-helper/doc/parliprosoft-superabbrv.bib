 abstract = {In this paper we offer a protocol for electronic deliberations that honors the rights of committee members and is consistent with Robert's Rules of Order. Implementing a formal protocol for electronic deliberations by academic committees ensures that all committee members will have an opportunity to participate fully in the committee's deliberations. In this way, electronic deliberations can provide as much opportunity for achieving a consensus as in-person meetings, while also offering the convenience associated with electronic communication. Should electronic deliberations not appear to be working in a particular situation, this protocol provides a mechanism for calling an in-person meeting, thereby providing the best of both worlds.},
