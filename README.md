Robots Rules of Order
===

Robots Rules (rr) is an automated customizable system available via rental arrangement to facilitate the proper conduct of meetings.  The initial intent is to start off with the well known public domain version of [Roberts Rules of Order](http://robertsrules.org/) or [here](http://www.bartleby.com/176/), also available [here](http://www.constitution.org/rror/rror--00.htm).

A good discussion and general introduction to this issue is here on this [Community Wiki](http://www.communitywiki.org/cw/RobertsRules).

Robots Rules is based upon an earlier project called ["Parliament"](http://parliament.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl), this is a wiki that contains source documentation of the "meeting helper" demonstration program the files of which are available on Sourceforge [parliament-0.0.1.tar.gz](http://sourceforge.net/projects/parliament/files/), which is the current basis of our system.
 
There is another project out there called [liberate](http://publicsphereproject.org/e-liberate/about/) which is a php based web site by  Doug Schuler of Evergreen State College.  It does not appear to be open source.

The basic model will be a subscription based model.
The subscriber pays:
* One time registration fee and receives an rr-module.  This attaches to:
** An HDMI Monitor locally provided
** A wireless Keyboard optionally provided
** A network connection (optional for use but not optional for maintenance)
* A monthly maintenance rental fee.
** Time bomb option is possible if the fee is unpaid.

Robots Rules will be a commercial open source device with support.  The technical implementation is detailed in the following [How Robots Rules Works](http://docbox.flint.com:8081/robotsrules/#HowItWorks)
